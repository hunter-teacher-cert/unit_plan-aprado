# Lesson 8
## Analyzing Results

### Objective
- Understand the difference between causation and correlation.
- Have some idea of conclusions that can be made based on the data.
- Understand the scope of conculsions that can be made from the data, avoid overgeneralizations.
- 

### Standards
9-12.CT.2 Collect and evaluate data from multiple sources for use in a computational artifact.
### Resources
- spurious correlations: http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations
- Videos (see slides)

### Activity
- Students will start by being randomly assigned to one of four groups to watch a video about the differences between causation and correlation.  See slides for links to videos, one group has the 2 shorter videos.
- After watching their videos students should fill out the brief form asking them to explain the main points of the video.
- Then students from each group are mixed (jigsaw) so there is one person who watched each video in the new groups.  They then discuss with their new group what they learned in their video.
- Followed by a whole class discussion and then looking at the website with spurious corelation 
- spurious correlations: http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations
- Discussion of possibilities of what the possibilits of coorelation can be (see slides)
- Wrap up video about some of ways to improve on analysis
### Assessment
- The assessment for this lesson is mostly on discussion participation both in groups and whole class.
- There is also the brief sheet asking students to summarize their code.
