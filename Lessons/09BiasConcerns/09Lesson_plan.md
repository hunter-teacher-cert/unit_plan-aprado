# Lesson 9
## Concerns of Errors/Bias

### Objective
- Students are aware of possible errors and bias with data sets (selection bias, observer bias, funding bias, surviovrship bias...)
- Students can explain how these bias can affect some communities more than others.
- Students can list ways to look for and try to avoid these types of errors. 

### Standards
9-12.CT.2 Collect and evaluate data from multiple sources for use in a computational artifact.
### Resources
- Bias in Stats 1st website: https://mailchimp.com/resources/data-bias-causes-effects/#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20types%20of%20bias%20in%20statistics%2C%20including%20confirmation,they%20can%20affect%20your%20business.
- Bias in Stats 2nd website: https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/types-of-statistical-bias
- 
### Activity
- We first will watch the short TED talk about bias in AI data sets.
- They will then spit into groups in read one of two articles about different types of bias in statistics (see links in resources).
- Students will complete the discussion sheet as they read their articles to prepare.
- Class discussion where members from each article state a different type of bias and how to watch for it.
- Discussion should in include confirmation bias, selection bias, outlier bias, observer bias, funding bias, omitted variable bias, survivorship bias, 
### Assessment
- The assessment for this lesson is mostly on discussion participation both in groups and whole class.
- There is also the brief sheet asking students to summarize their code.
