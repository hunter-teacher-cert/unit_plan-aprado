# Lesson 5
## Bivariate Data and Line Graph

### Objective
- Understand the what it means for data to be bivariate.
- Use the line() function to connect points to form a line graph
- Use map() to convert scales 
- Lable both axis with scales and title the line graph. 

### Standards
9-12.CT.3 Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set.

### Activity
- Start by going over what is meant by bivariate data.  The data points are related to each other.  They are not just two independent lists of numbers.  You can use this type of data to make meaningful 2-d graphs like a line-graph.
- Look over data set spreadsheet, stressing how the data pairs are connected.
- Go over the example final project of the line graph for global temperature changes over time.  Explain that the temperatures are "differences from the mean" and not just extremly cold temperatues.
- Go through the starter code skeleton instructions and answer any questions. 
- Have a whole class discussuion and diagram on the white board how each axis has a very different scale before they start.
- Using driver-navigator, have students work in pairs to complete the line graph.
- Check on each group as they are working on it.  If there are many students having the same issue (scaling the axis differently) stop the class and go over as a whole group.
- Go over finished codes and examine the differences in the way different groups did it.   
### Assessment
- As groups are working check in with them to make sure they are on the right track and both group members are involved.  
- Students will submit their final p5 projects and assessment on how well they met the criteria of the project.
