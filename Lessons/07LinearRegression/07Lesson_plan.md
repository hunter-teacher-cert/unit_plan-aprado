# Lesson 7
## Linear Regression

### Objective
- Understand what is meant by a linear regression model.
- What does the equation (slope,intercept) of the line mean?
- What is meant by posiitive or negative correlation.
- What is meant by strong or weak correlation.  

### Standards
9-12.CT.3 Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set.
9-12.CT.7 Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data.

### Activity
- The first activity is the exploring the code of a completed program that allows them to plot dots on a graph and the code updates the linear regression line as they add points.
- Students will work in groups to complete the question sheet about how it works.
- We will then have a full class discussion of what linear regression is.  What is positive and negative correlations (examples of each)?  What is strong and weak correlations (examples of each)?
- Watch the brief video about calculating it (we will not do it directly in this lesson).
- Have students come up with examples of variables that might be related and what they think the correlation would be.
- The remainder of the class the students will be given a p5 code of a scatter plot and they will work in driver navigator pairs to draw a regression line (the accuracy of the math is less important today)
### Assessment
- Students will be assessed on their answers to the question sheet about the regression code activity. 
- As groups are working check in with them to make sure they are on the right track and both group members are involved.  
- Students will submit their final p5 projects and assessment on how well they met the criteria of the project.
