# Lesson 3
## Creating Bar Graphs and using map() function

### Objective
- Understand the basics of what the map function does.
- Use the map function to convert from one scale (the one the data is in) into another (one that looks nice on the graph)
- Use data to create a bar graph with scaled rectangles, a scale and lables.
  
### Standards
- 9-12.CT.3 Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set.
### Resources
- p5 final: https://editor.p5js.org/ajprado@gmail.com/sketches/zZ1_I8u1c
- p5 starter: https://editor.p5js.org/ajprado@gmail.com/sketches/zZ1_I8u1c
- spreadsheet:

### Activities
- Go over the basic map() function properties as a whole class.  Explain how it can be used to change the scale while keeping it proportional.
- Have students work in pairs to explore just the map function examples (see slides).  Go over what they noticed and what questions and concerns they still have.
- Look over the data set of animals names and cuteness in the spreadsheet.
- Explain the goal of the bar graph project and go over the comments in the starter code as a whole class.
- Take a minute to sketch out what it will eventually look like on the white board, and talk about how things will line up.
- Have them work in driver/navigator pairs to create code to create the bar graph for the data.  Make sure there is a scale, lables and a title. (see final code or slide show)

### Assessment
- As groups are working check in with them to make sure they are on the right track and both group members are involved.  
- Students will submit their final p5 projects and assessment on how well they met the criteria of the project.
