# Lesson 6
## Scatter Plot

### Objective
- Understand what multivariate data is.
- Graph a scatter plot including scales and lables
- Compare the correlations between differen combinations of varaibles.   

### Standards
9-12.CT.3 Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set.

### Activity
- Discuss with the class that multivartiate data is just the extension of univariate data.  Look over some of the example data sets in the slides.
- Explain the realestate data set categores, answer any questions they might have.  Ask, what categories they think will be most closely related?
- Go over the starter code with them.  This has a completly working example of a scatter plot.  Discuss the goal of them changing the pair of variables to something else.  Possibly do more than one pair if they can.
- Have students workin driver-navigator pairs to pick pairs of variables and code them.  Make sure they areadjusgint the scales and labels properly.  
- Challenge:  can you display 4 different scatter plots of the same data set at once?
- Have students share their scatter plot images on the class padlet (sort of like an online bulleting board).  Discuss which ones had any sorts of correlation and why they think that might be the case. 
### Assessment
- As groups are working check in with them to make sure they are on the right track and both group members are involved.  
- Students will submit their final p5 projects and assessment on how well they met the criteria of the project.
