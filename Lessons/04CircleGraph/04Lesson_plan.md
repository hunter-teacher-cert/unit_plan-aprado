# Lesson 4
## Create a circle graph

### Objective
- Use map to convert percentages to angles in radians.
- Create a circle graph using the arc() function.
- Lable and title the circle graph. 

### Standards
9-12.CT.3 Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set.

### Activity
- Go over the arc() function, spending time on each input into the function.  Make sure to mention "PIE" mode.
- Briefly explain how radians for a full circle go from 0 to 2*PI, don't stress the math, the map function will do it for you.
- Show them the example of the final project and read over the instructions in the starter code, see if they have any questions.
- Have them work in driver/navigtor pairs to complete the circle graphs, including colors, lables and titles.
- Check on each group as the go, some may need some support with converting each % into radians using map.  Another possible issue might be having the PIE sections on top of each other.  
### Assessment
- As groups are working check in with them to make sure they are on the right track and both group members are involved.  
- Students will submit their final p5 projects and assessment on how well they met the criteria of the project.
