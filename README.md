by Adam Prado

-----

### General Overview
This unit is an introduction to Data Science using javaScript.  It will start on collecting data and data types associated with storing the data (JSON, CSV, ...).  It will then move on to cleaning, filtering and analyzing the data set.  It will discuss ways of presenting the data in tables, charts or graphs.  Finally, we will discuss what types of conclusions can be made with the information that we have created.

### Motivation for Unit
Data science is a rapidly growing field in computer science and too often misunderstood my many people.  This unit will introduce students to how the data is collected, anlyzed and presented.  It will encourage students to gather information and make conclusions that could have an impact on themselves and their communities.  It will give them some tools to evaluate data science presented from others.  It will also give students insight into how data science and coding can be used in other fields/careers other than math and computer science.
