# Lesson 2
## Creating functions with univariate data

### Objective
- Understanding of what univariate data is.
- Review of measure of center (mean, median, mode) as well as dispersion (range, standard deviaiton)
- Create functions in p5 to find measures of center and dispersion for a data set.
- Create code that counts data that meets a certain condition from a data set.
- 
### Standards
9-12.CT.2 Collect and evaluate data from multiple sources for use in a computational artifact.

### Activities
- Introduction to what is meant by "univariate data"
- Have students come up with examples of univariate data sets, class discussion.
- Review of math measures of center mean, median, mode
- Review of measures of dispersion range, standard deviations
- Go over expectations for the starter code skeleton and what the students are to complete.
- Split students into pairs for Driver-Navigator to complete the assignment (see starter code comments for instructions)
- Have them start coding together, switching driver/navigator every 7 minutes.
- If there are several groups with the same error/confusion stop the class to go over the concern together
- Go over some of the code before the end of class, showing students different techniques for solving the tasks
  
### Assessment
- As groups are working check in with them to make sure they are on the right track and both group members are involved.  
- Students will submit their final p5 projects and assessment on how many of the functions/scripts they completed.
